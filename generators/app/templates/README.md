## Getting started

this project was bootstrapped with [td-react-boilerplate](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-td-react-boilerplate).
A homemade boilerplate for a lightweight and unopinionated react app with [parcel.js](https://parceljs.org/).

To get started with development you only need one simple command:

`<%= pkgManager %> start`
